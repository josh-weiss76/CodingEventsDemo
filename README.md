# CodingEventsDemo

You should write three sections. The first should describe the purpose of the app. The second should describe the current state of the app. The third and final section should describe the future improvements you want to make to the app including your notes about the Person class.

The purpose of the CodingEventsDemo app is to store upcoming event information, to include the name of the event, description, POC contact email, type of event, and any # tags that are associated with the event.  

The app lets the user search for upcoming events by the event category or by # tag.  The app allows the user to add new # tags, as well as event category.  Finally, the app allows the user to add, delete, and list events.

In the future, we will add the ability to input information of the individual user of the application.  This information includes the user's name, their userId, their contact information (email), and their preferences for event notifications.  Once that functionality is added, we are looking at adding future funcationality to include pushing upcoming event information for events happening in the user's area, this would be based off of their selected prefences for # tags and event categories.
